An app to detect falls, recognize sign language and read text from images. It was built for my final year project.


# Companera

Companera is an innovative healthcare and accessibility project that combines **sign language recognition** and **fall detection** using **TensorFlow**, gyroscope sensors, and automated notifications. It aims to assist both individuals with hearing impairments and elderly users by providing real-time alerts and communication.

## Features

- **Sign Language Interpreter:**  
  Recognizes and translates hand gestures into text in real time using a TensorFlow-based model.

- **Fall Detection System:**  
  Uses gyroscope sensors to detect falls and automatically sends email alerts to designated emergency contacts.

- **Real-Time Alerts:**  
  Sends notifications via email to ensure immediate assistance for users in case of emergencies.
